# Problem
Develop scalable time-series forecasting model to predict sales from store-product combinations.

## Approach
The team used a wide range of approached to solve this problem, some of which are documented in the archive folder. These include: Autoregressive moving average (ARIMA), Croston's exponential smoothing, Recurrent Neural Networks, Mixture Density Networks, and Feed forward neural networks. 

The winning model was a feedforward model, which still has to be refined.
